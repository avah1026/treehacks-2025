# HeartHack

> Making the soul-sucking dating apps suck even more, one swipe at a time!

Stop wasting time on swiping. Simply describe what are your green and red flags
in a potential match, and let HeartHack swipe for you.

**Yes it's clearly for-the-lols project, but akshually it does solve a specific problem (kind of):**

By default, most dating apps let you specify only very basic filtering criteria:
age and gender. If you want anything more fine-grained (like education, family
plans, hell even covid vaccine), you have to bite the bullet and pay up. But
even this won't save you from seeing all those shirtless pics ðŸ¥µ This is why we
built HeartHack.
